Git repository for of the model of arXiv:1503.00009. This is a model in which hidden-sector states are charged under a new confining gauge group, leading to QCD-like showers. The showers produce both stable, invisible dark matter, as well as unstable states that decay back to the SM. This produces ``semi-visible'' jets.

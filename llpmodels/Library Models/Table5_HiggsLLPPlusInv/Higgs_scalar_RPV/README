HIGGS PRODUCTION, 2 LLPs + INVISIBLE: SCALAR LLP WITH RPV-TYPE DECAY
Brian Shuve

This model has direct production of the SM Higgs, which decays to a pair of "neutralinos",
which in turn decay to LLP sneutrino + SM neutrino.

The parameters to change in the simplified model are:

1) The mass of the LLP (PID=1000014), default value 1.00000e+01

2) The mass of the parent Higgs (PID=25), default value 1.250000e+01

3) The mass of the intermediate "neutralino" (PID=1000023)

4) The width of the LLP in the WIDTH block (same PID), default value 1.974600e-13, as well as the 
width of the intermediate neutralino

HIGGS PRODUCTION, 2 LLPs: SCALAR LLP
Brian Shuve

This model has direct production of the SM Higgs, which decays to a pair of scalars (in the model, these are additional
Higgs states). These scalars are the LLPs.

The parameters to change in the simplified model are:

1) The mass of the LLP (PID=36), default value 5.00000e+01

2) The mass of the parent Higgs (PID=25), default value 1.250000e+01

3) The width of the LLP in the WIDTH block (same PID), default value 1.974600e-13
